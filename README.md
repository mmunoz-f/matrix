Linear algebra c++ library

## About the project
This is a simple project focused on linear algebra. It implements basic classes for matrices and vectors and includes common operations related to them.

I know there are countless math libraries out there, many (if not all) of which do a much better job than this one. I KNOW.
The whole point of this project was to revisit the basics of linear algebra, learn, and test my skills with metaprogramming in C++. This involved working with generic types, templates, and other fun stuff.

Additionally, I wanted to try out the Google Test library, so I created a few tests. They're all pretty basic, and I didnâ€™t really explore the library to its full potential. But hey, itâ€™s there to show that I know the basics of unit testing and how to implement it. ðŸ˜Š

## Whats Next?
This is neither a finished project nor a project that was ever meant to be finished. There are a few TODOs scattered around: in the code itself, on a pile of papers on my desk, and, of course, lost in that dark corner of my brain where all my other unfinished projects reside.

BUT, if I ever revisit this project, here are some things you can expect:

- Add support for complex numbers to ensure compatibility with them.
- Fix the code to make it truly generic (I know thereâ€™s something that isnâ€™t quite there yet).
- Probably rewrite the entire thing while looking for the "best" way to do it (Iâ€™m always learning, which means the moment I look at this code again, Iâ€™ll want to tear it apart and cry).
- Unify the tests.
